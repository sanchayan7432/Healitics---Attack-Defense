# Healitics---Attack-Defense
Healitics is a role-based prompt engine which uses Gemini API to predict disease and suggest diagnostics. But the system and role prompt sometimes are seen as the developer's intellectual property. So in this project my target is to make an attack and defense module using reinforcement learning so that there be a race condition between them.
